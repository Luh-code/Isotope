# This project isn't dead...
... just put on hold. I don't really have any inspiration to work in this right now. I will at some point likely come back to it though, because I still find it interesting. I wanted to create this as an editor at first, because I didn't find anything that I liked using, but at this point I have a NVChad config I am quite happy with, so yeah.

# Isotope
Isotope is a development platformn written in Rust.
The interface is split up into panes, the positioning, size, style and co, are dictated by a pane manager. Similar to WM's in Linux.
The Idea is to have a ecosystem of packages, that each add some functionality like a new pane.

# Why use Isotope instead of something dedicated?
In the end it comes down to personal preference. But the theory is, that you can set up a dev environment or whatever, that perfectly fits your worklow.
That is why the Idea for Isotope orignally started out as a code editor, as there are huge differences in coding workflows, so using a one-size-fits-all solution like VSCode may, besides it's customizability and extendability not always be fitting for everyone.

## little disclaimer
I am a hobbyist and this project is one of my first times using Rust, so please don't go to hard on me when it comes to code quality :D
Also this is not at a usable state yet, or even anywhere close to it. If you like the idea behind it, I invite you to take it and build your own system to accomplish it, I would even love to hear about it, because as I said earlier, I like the concept, but don't have the energy to work on it currently :(
